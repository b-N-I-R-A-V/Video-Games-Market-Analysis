# About
GamesCo, a video game company, wants to make data driven decisions for their future development of games. This project is aimed at performing descriptive analysis of the historical sales figures from North America, Europe, Japan, Global, and Others to help design new games to compete in the current market.

# Tools and Techniques
The majority of this project was done using Microsoft Excel. This includes the demonstration of the following skills:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Summarizing
3. Excel
4. Pivot Tables
5. Descriptive Analysis
6. Report Writing and Story Telling with Data

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis comes from VGChartz. Here is the link to the dataset. [VGChartz Dataset Link](https://images.careerfoundry.com/public/courses/intro-to-data/E1/vgsales.xlsx)

## Challenges
The dataset from VGChartz has limitations because it no longer estimates software sales due to the complexity of tracking digital sales reliably. Hardware sales estimates are based on retail sampling and may vary up to 10% from actual totals. The data is frequently updated to match official figures but can fluctuate, and there's a difference between VGChartz's sell-through data and manufacturers' sell-in data, except when consoles are discontinued.

# Key Questions
The following were the most important questions that we answered through the analysis:
* Are certain types of games more popular than others?
* What other publishers will likely be the main competitors in certain markets?
* How have their sales figures varied between geographic regions over time?
