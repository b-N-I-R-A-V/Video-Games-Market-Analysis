# About
GamesCo, a video game company, wants to make data driven decisions for their future development of games. This project is aimed at performing descriptive analysis of the historical sales figures from North America, Europe, Japan, Global, and Others to help design new games to compete in the current market.

# Tools and Techniques
The majority of this project was done using Microsoft Excel. This includes the demonstration of the following skills:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Summarizing
3. Excel
4. Pivot Tables
5. Descriptive Analysis
6. Report Writing and Story Telling with Data

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis comes from VGChartz. Here is the link to the dataset. [VGChartz Dataset Link](https://images.careerfoundry.com/public/courses/intro-to-data/E1/vgsales.xlsx)
Before doing aggregation, summarization, or analysis, it was important to have a look at the data and understanding what kind of information do I have. This helped me set up my mind on what type information am I working with and be prepared. Further, doing this process made it clear what type of questions will I be able to answer and which questions will not be answered by this analysis. In other words, I discovered the limitations of the dataset. Moreover, to check for biases I explored the source of the dataset as it was important to look for any biases present in the dataset as biases often yields misleading conclusions
# Key Questions
The following were the most important questions that we answered through the analysis:
* Are certain types of games more popular than others?
* What other publishers will likely be the main competitors in certain markets?
* How have their sales figures varied between geographic regions over time?
