# About
GamesCo, a video game company, wants to make data driven decisions for their future development of games. This project is aimed at performing descriptive analysis of the historical sales figures from North America, Europe, Japan, Global, and Others to help design new games to compete in the current market.

# Tools and Techniques
The majority of this project was done using Microsoft Excel. This includes the demonstration of the following skills:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Summarizing
3. Excel
4. Pivot Tables
5. Descriptive Analysis
6. Report Writing and Story Telling with Data

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis comes from VGChartz. Here is the link to the dataset. [VGChartz Dataset Link](https://images.careerfoundry.com/public/courses/intro-to-data/E1/vgsales.xlsx)

### Challenges
The dataset from VGChartz has limitations because it no longer estimates software sales due to the complexity of tracking digital sales reliably. Hardware sales estimates are based on retail sampling and may vary up to 10% from actual totals. The data is frequently updated to match official figures but can fluctuate, and there's a difference between VGChartz's sell-through data and manufacturers' sell-in data, except when consoles are discontinued.

Following steps were taken to deal with issues related to dataset:
1. Identified columns with missing data.
2. NA units column was completely empty and thus was removed.
3. Missing categorical variabels were filled with NA to indicate missing data.
4. Removed duplicated rows.
5. Imputed mean values for quantitative variables to fill-in missing data.

# Key Questions
The following were the most important questions that we answered through the analysis:
* Are certain types of games more popular than others?
* What other publishers will likely be the main competitors in certain markets?
* How have their sales figures varied between geographic regions over time?

# Results
Below are excerpts from the presentation file. The presentation file contains all of the results and recommendations.
One of the assumptions from the stakeholders was that the market share remained the same for the 4 different regions highlighed in the dataset. This was effectively debunked with the help of the following line chart. This helped in improving our understanding about the market.
