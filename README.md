# About
GamesCo, a video game company, wants to make data driven decisions for their future development of games. This project is aimed at performing descriptive analysis of the historical sales figures from North America, Europe, Japan, Global, and Others to help design new games to compete in the current market.

# Tools and Techniques
The majority of this project was done using Microsoft Excel. This includes the demonstration of the following skills:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Summarizing
3. Excel
4. Pivot Tables
5. Descriptive Analysis
6. Report Writing and Story Telling with Data

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis comes from VGChartz. Here is the link to the dataset. [VGChartz Dataset Link](https://images.careerfoundry.com/public/courses/intro-to-data/E1/vgsales.xlsx)

## Challenges
1. Reliability of Software Sales Estimates: VGChartz no longer estimates how much software is sold, as digital sales have become more significant and challenging to track accurately. They now only record official shipment and sales data provided by developers and publishers.

2. Hardware Sales Estimates: VGChartz continues to estimate hardware sales weekly, using retail samples and trends in individual countries to extrapolate figures for broader regions. These estimates typically fall within 10% of actual totals.

3. Comparison and Updating: VGChartz regularly compares its sales estimates against official figures released by console manufacturers and regional trackers like Famitsu and NPD. They adjust their estimates accordingly to improve accuracy, which can lead to frequent updates.

4. Sell-through vs. Sell-in Data: VGChartz's estimates are based on sell-through data (units sold to consumers), while console manufacturers often report sell-in data (units shipped to retailers). This difference means VGChartz's figures may not always match official manufacturer data, except when discontinued consoles have completely sold out.

# Key Questions
The following were the most important questions that we answered through the analysis:
* Are certain types of games more popular than others?
* What other publishers will likely be the main competitors in certain markets?
* How have their sales figures varied between geographic regions over time?
